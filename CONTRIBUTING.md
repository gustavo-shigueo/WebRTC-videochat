# Contributing to this project

Although this is a small scale personal project, intended only to help me understand the basics of WebRTC, there are lots of bugs I am aware of which I want to fix
and some new functionalities that I want to add. You can help by reporting any bugs you find using this application or making suggestions by opening an issue, or
if you want to help in a more direct way, feel free to fork this repo and submit a pull request.

This repo contains a GH Action that commits all of the changes to the main branch to the subtree branches `gh-pages` and `socket-server`, so there is no need to
commit to each of them individually.
